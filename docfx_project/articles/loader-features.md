# Misc Loader Features
## Quick Loading
### LoadIntoMain
Load straight into a world for testing purposes by adding `--sdk.loadinto main` to your launch options.
You can configure what gets loaded in the `UserData/_RedLoader.cfg` file.

### LoadSave
You can directly load into a save game with the `--savegame <id>` launch option.  
You can find the ids of your save games in the `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\LocalLow\Endnight\SonsOfTheForest\Saves\<userid>\SinglePlayer` directory.

## Boot.txt
You can create a `boot.txt` in your game directory with a command on each line to be executed on game start.
