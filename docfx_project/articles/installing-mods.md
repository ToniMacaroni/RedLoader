# Installing Mods

To install mods you can use the Mod Manager found [here](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/RedManager).  
If you instead want to manually install mods do the following:

1) Download the mod zip.
2) Extract the the contents of the zip into your `Sons Of The Forest/Mods` folder.

After that you should have a .dll file and a folder with the same name inside your Mods directory.
